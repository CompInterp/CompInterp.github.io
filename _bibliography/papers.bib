  abstract = {We propose χ-net, an intrinsically interpretable architecture combining the compositional multilinear structure of tensor networks with the expressivity and efficiency of deep neural networks. χ-nets retain equal accuracy compared to their baseline counterparts. Our novel, efficient diagonalisation algorithm, ODT, reveals linear low-rank structure in a multilayer SVHN model. We leverage this toward formal weightbased interpretability and model compression.},
