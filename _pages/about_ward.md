## **Ward** Gauderis

Hello!
I'm a PhD researcher studying **compositionality** in AI --- how explicit structure and emergent behaviour interact in intelligent systems. My work bridges symbolic and sub-symbolic AI, with a focus on models that are inherently interpretable by design and can reason and create in human-like ways.

**How can the _compositional design_ of a model's structure improve its _compositional behaviour_?**

My PhD project, Q-CHARM, explores this question by distinguishing between the architecture of a model (its **compositional design**) and the structure that emerges during learning (its **compositional behaviour**). The goal is to uncover how architectural inductive biases can support interpretability, generalisation, and creative reasoning. Learn more about my work [here](https://wardgauderis.github.io/)!
